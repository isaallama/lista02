# Assignment Responses
The following project contains the answers to the second test required for my training as a Junior Fullstack Developer.

## Getting Started
In order to configure your machine to execute the following scripts, some requirements will be needed. Therefore, here is an example of the steps to follow to get a local copy.

### Prerequisites
<p><strong>Node.js:</strong> v20.12.2 </p>
<p>Why to use <strong>Node.js</strong>:
<li> It is a open source server environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server. </li></p>

<p> <strong>NPM:</strong> 10.5.0 </p>
 <p>Why to use <strong>NPM</strong>:
<li> It is a package manager and a software registry that developers can use to find, build, and manage code packages. Please be sure npm is installed and updated. </li></p>
 
<p><strong>prompt-sync:</strong> it is a function that creates prompting functions.</p> 

### Installation Steps
<p>
 <strong>Node.js:</strong> 
<ul>
  <li>To download Node.js click <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager" title="Download Node.js">here</a>;</li>
  <li>To learn how to install it you may click <a href="https://radixweb.com/blog/installing-npm-and-nodejs-on-windows-and-mac" title="Install Node.js">here</a>;</li>
</ul>
</p> 

<p>
  <strong>NPM:</strong>
  <h5>On Windows:</h5> 
  <ul>
    <l>To install on Windows NPM follow these steps:</l>
    <li>Open Command Prompt (you can search for "cmd" in the Start menu);</li>
    <li>Run the following commands to check if Node.js and npm were installed successfully:</li>

   
  ```sh
  node -v
npm -v
  ```
   <li>You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <h5>For other operating systems you may try:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Click <a href="https://monovm.com/blog/install-npm-on-ubuntu/" title="Download NPM">here</a> to learn how to install NPM on Linux;</li>
    <li>Click <a href="https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html" title="Download NPM">here</a> to learn how to install NPM on Mac.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

## To Use 
<p>After completing all the requirements, it is time to use the code.</p>

<p>If you want to clone it, please follow the example exactly as shown, in your command line type:</p>

From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/isaallama/lista02.git
# Go into the repository
cd lista02
```
## To Execute
<p>Looking for better understanding, each answer is enumerated with the respective question number. So to execute the scripts type in your command line:</p>
 
```bash
 node exercicioXX.js
```
<p>In which 'XX' represents the question and consequently the answer number.</p>


<h3>About the scripts:</h3>
<p>Each script contains one answer from each second test quest. However, there are different ways to interact with it: </p>
<ul>
 <li> Some scripts will allow the user to interact with them: you can type a number, a name, or other information to customize the output. For example:</li>
<p align="center"> 
<img width="600" src="https://github.com/isaallama/lista02/assets/168743234/3b1d13cd-012d-4ee2-92c8-35e4f1a116f8" alt="Exercício01">
</p>
 <p>Here is an example in which: </p>
  <li>a. first: type the number of cigarettes smoked in a day</li>
  <li>b. second: type how many years you have smoked</li>
  <li>Then the script will calculate how many days of life were lost by smoking 'x' cigarettes per day for 'y' years.</li>
 <p></p>
 <p> Others scripts you may change these informations <em>(a number, a name, or other information)</em> only in the code. For example:
 <p align="center"> 
  <img width="600"  src="https://github.com/isaallama/lista02/assets/168743234/1412b7d9-5854-431c-aa64-a65eccd47b55" alt="Exercício47">
 </p>
  <p>In the example above, you can change the numbers <em>(10, 10, 5, 4)</em> in the code as you wish.</p>
  <li>The script named 'exercicio20' requires opening the file named 'pessoas', as the script reads information from it.</li>
</ul>
</p>
